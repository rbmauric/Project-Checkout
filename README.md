"AISLE2K" (Working Title)

Summary: A 2D puzzle platformer with an economy based powerup system. 80's Anime Art Style, but set in the distant future. Built on Unity. MVP (for now) is a level showcasing all the powerups ending with a boss.

Gameplay: Levels are split into "slices" which require a certain task to complete. The player starts with a certain amount of money and a time limit, and are required to manage their money properly to complete the task. Money will be spent on utility items, weapons, and extra hearts or time, and can be obtained by defeating certain enemies or by simply finding it lying around.

Story: (Tentative) In the distant future, Rainforest Corp. has taken over the grocery store industry and stores are no longer operated by human beings. However, one store owner seeks revenge, visiting different stores and destroying the machines that have stolen everything from her.
